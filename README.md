## About

This is my personal start page. Every time I open up a new tab in my browser, it opens up this page.

Hosted at https://start.harveywilliams.net/.

## Features

**The links** are to sites which I use everyday.

**The background image** is loaded from [National Geographic's Photo of the Day](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/photography/photo-of-the-day). Each day, they upload a new photo of the world which is loaded on my start page by consuming the API.

**To ensure that the website always loads fast** I have experimented in using a Service Worker - all resources are cached and retrieved from the Service Worker cache so the page should always load immediately.
